# DS ML Practise
 This repository stems from the online courses I completed on Udemy, where I utilized Python for tackling Data Science challenges. The instructor, Jose Portilla, who is a Data Scientist, delivered the course content, making it highly valuable. I intend to share only the iPython notebooks I've practiced with, uploading them as I complete them. This approach aids me in monitoring my learning progress and serves as a quick reference while I'm working.
